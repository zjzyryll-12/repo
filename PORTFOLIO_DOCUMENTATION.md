* **Result/Output**: Created comprehensive custom CSS in resources/css/app.css with all styling needed for the portfolio including responsive navigation, card layouts, timeline styling, mobile responsiveness, and professional color scheme. Updated package.json to include Tailwind CSS dependencies for build process, created tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js for CSS processing.

---

### Task: Update Layout to Use Custom CSS
* **Prompt used**: "Update the layout file to use custom CSS classes instead of Tailwind CSS utility classes"
* **Result/Output**: Modified resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php to remove Tailwind CSS utility classes and use custom CSS classes from app.css. Simplified the HTML structure while maintaining the same visual design.

---
